# Line42: A Coding Blog

A blog, not built with WordPress.

This project was created using .NET Core MVC, C#, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Why not WordPress?

The goal of this project was to exercise my ASP.NET Core skills in coding a project from start to finish in a short amount of time.

When creating this project I worked on improving my workflow in the early stages of a new project.
